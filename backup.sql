Use double stick foam tape to attach to top of monitro. \r\n\r\nSome of the design concepts: \r\nThe ball diameter is 20 mm.\r\nThe 3 arms have 20 mm ball diameter indents. However the arms have been moved inward 0.5 mm to provide a slight preload on the ball to keep in place.\r\n\r\nThe preload will be sensitive to the arm length and inward movement of the three arms in clip_141114g.stl. A higher preload will hold the mirror in place more tightly. Shorter arms increase the ball preload because they will be stiffer (proportional to L^3). Moving the arm radially inward more also increases the preload. The limit to these two effects is that the arms will break when inserting the ball.\r\n\r\nIf you use the design concept for other applications, please share with the community.','2014-11-16 16:43:30','2014-11-16 16:56:16',216,0,'39','2','3','p141116a_mirror_mount.JPG',0,0),(483,'Robot Ready','This robot was created using a mobile app, Dr Fluffs Robot Factory.
